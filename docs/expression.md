mRNA
==================

For historical reasons, the parameters file for mRNA data is called
`expression.params`.
For the content of this file see [the HD data parameters](hd-params.md) and [the study-specific parameters](study-params.md).

Input files
-----------

See [subject-sample-mapping.md](subject-sample-mapping.md)


This is the data file format:

| `ID_REF`    | `GSM210005` | `GSM210006` | `GSM210007` |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1007\_s\_at | 0           | 179.15      |367.436      |

The first row must contain `ID_REF` as the first column, which will be the probe
name in the respective platform. These must match the probe names when the
platform was loaded. The order is not important, but the set of probes in the
data file must match exactly the set of probes for the platform.

The subsequent rows are the sample names, whose set must match that of those in
the `SAMPLE_CD` column in the mapping file. Again, the order is not important.

Empty cells are not allowed. Zeros, negative values and NaNs (input as U+FFFD)
*are* allowed and have the same effect among each other (see below).
